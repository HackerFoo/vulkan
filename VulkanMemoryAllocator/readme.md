# VulkanMemoryAllocator

Slightly high level Haskell bindings to the [Vulkan Memory
Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
library.

These bindings are intended to be imported qualified and do not feature the
`Vma` prefixes on commands, structures or constants.

This builds on the [vulkan
Package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vulkan). It uses the same method
of generating slightly-high-level bindings, see the [vulkan
readme](../readme.md) for more info.
